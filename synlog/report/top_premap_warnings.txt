@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT462 :|Net work_flow_inst.myicon_inst.CONTROL0[13] appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT531 :|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 0 sequential elements including work_flow_inst.myila_inst.U0/I_NO_D\.U_ILA/U_STAT/U_DIRTY_LDC.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"f:\pstr17r5b\pwr_rst.v":37:1:37:6|Found inferred clock top|clk which controls 1103 sequential elements including pwr_rst_inst.rst_reg. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :|Found inferred clock myicon|U0/U_ICON/I_YES_BSCAN_U_BS/iDRCK_LOCAL_inferred_clock which controls 0 sequential elements including work_flow_inst.myicon_inst.U0/U_ICON/U_SYNC/G_SYNC_WORD\[6\]\.I_EQ0\.U_FDR. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :|Found inferred clock myicon|U0/iUPDATE_OUT_inferred_clock which controls 0 sequential elements including work_flow_inst.myicon_inst.U0/U_ICON/U_iDATA_CMD. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"f:\pstr17r5b\parallel_wr.v":80:4:80:9|Found inferred clock top|clk_2 which controls 451 sequential elements including ad9914_ctrl_inst2.ad9914_reg_wr_inst.parallel_wr_inst.rd_reg. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
